        The Target Higher-Ed aims to help students to choose their dream
        schools. Our mission is to provide personalized, innovative services and
        admission products to help students knock down barriers and achieve
        their academic goals. We are solely dedicated towards assisting the
        students to shortlist the best universities based on their course
        preference, location, rank, entrance exam score and financial
        affordability. Our college content—based on feedback from real
        students—will help you make a list of schools that fit you academically,
        socially, and financially. Spend your time and effort applying to the
        schools that will best serve your goals!
